    "For this project, we implemented the Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm described by Chen et al.(2014). This algorithm is a variant of traditional Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method, in which it utilizes the efficiencies of stochastic gradient and therefore allowing desired objective to be maintained even when friction is added. We optimized the algorithm utilizing package `numba` and Cholesky decomposition. Then we tested the algorithm based on two simulated examples and a real dataset and compare its performance to two other Monte Carlo methods using the Python package `Pyhmc` and `Pystan`. Codes are available on the GitHUb repository (https://github.com/azhou96/STA663-Final-Project-SGHMC) and the installation instructions are available in the `README.md` file.\n",

    "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a MCMC algorithm which resides in Metropolis-Hastings framework. It is a methods that is often used to achieve desired proposals of distant states. HMC algorithm borrows its idea from physics – it defines the target distribution as potential energy as well as a kinetic energy term parametrized by momentum variables. HMC is especially advantageous in that it integrates the gradient information, allowing HMC to quickly explores the state space. This algorithm, however, contains limitation that a computation for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system is required, which would be improbable to implement in data set with large sample size. Chen et al (2014) in their paper, provides us with a refined HMC, called Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC). In order to avoid such limitation, SGHMC utilizes stochastic gradient on minibatches of the dataset with noise and incorporates a friction term. This friction term will then be able to counteract with the introduced noise."

Users will have to approximate these variables, leading to result being potentially deviated from proposed distribution. Another limitation of SGHMC is that the friction term is not available in practice. Therefore uncertainty occurs when we choose different methods to estimate the friction term."
